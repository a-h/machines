# Keyboard Configuration

I use the AnnePro2 mechanical keyboard as my main keyboard. I recently replaced the firmware with QMK to allow for more customisation ([blog article here](https://headblockhead.com/2022/10/29/updating-the-firmware-of-my-annepro2-keyboard-to-qmk/)) and wanted to publish my keymappings. You can view, edit and compile the .json file [on the QMK configurator websie](https://config.qmk.fm/#/annepro2/c18/LAYOUT_60_ansi). Make sure you upload the .json to see my changes.
